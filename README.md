## 📊 Executive Summary

### **The Business Impact**
Identified a **$13.45 Million annual capital preservation opportunity** by deploying a predictive "Digital Firewall" that identifies potential defaults before capital is deployed. The solution delivers a **43.8x Return on Investment (ROI)** by reducing realized losses without sacrificing lending volume.

### **The Challenge**
The institution faced a critical **13.82% portfolio default rate**, nearly triple the industry benchmark of 5%, resulting in **$36.15M in annual capital destruction**. Traditional underwriting relied on static thresholds that failed to capture the non-linear risk correlation between income volatility and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios.

### **The Solution**
Developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline analyzing a **$435.7M portfolio** using **SMOTEENN resampled XGBoost** architectures. The project bridged the gap between raw data and executive strategy by translating model metrics (93.04% Recall) into a **Tri-Tier Decision Engine** for automated approvals, manual audits, and high-risk rejections.



### **The Key Finding**
Feature engineering revealed that a custom **Composite Risk Score (CRS)**—combining payment-to-income and loan-to-value—was **2.4x more predictive** than external credit grades alone. Statistical testing identified a **"Toxic DTI Threshold" at 45%**, where default probability surges by **215%**, providing a clear data-driven guardrail for underwriting.

## 🎯 Phase 1: Business Problem

### 📉 The Situation
Between January and December 2021, the bank’s retail lending division experienced a sharp deterioration in portfolio credit quality. While peer institutions maintain a **5.00%** default benchmark, our internal rate climbed to **13.82%**.

With **38,576 active loans** and an average size of **$11,296**, the bank faces an annual loss exposure of over **$36 Million**. This trend is accelerating, rising by 22.3% over the 12-month period, necessitating an immediate shift from static grading to predictive modeling.

![Loan Default Trend 2021](Images/laon_default_trend_2021.PNG)

### ❓ Critical Business Questions
1.  **Borrower Profiles:** Which borrower characteristics and loan features most strongly correlate with default?
2.  **Point of Origination:** Can we accurately decline or adjust terms for high-risk applicants before the loan is issued?
3.  **Early Warning System:** Can we trigger proactive collection interventions for existing loans based on risk probability?

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

### 💰 Financial Impact
Every 1% reduction in the default rate saves approximately **$4.36 Million**. Reverting to the industry benchmark of 5% would recover an estimated **$38.4 Million** in annual lost capital.

### 🎯 Strategic Impact (Unit Economics)
High default rates inflate the "Effective Cost" of every loan. By optimizing the portfolio mix, we improve the **LTV-to-CAC ratio**, ensuring that interest revenue from "Safe" borrowers is no longer cannibalized to cover the principal losses of "At-Risk" segments.

### ⚖️ Competitive Impact (Adverse Selection)
Our current default rate creates a competitive disadvantage. To remain solvent, we must inflate interest rates, leading to **Adverse Selection**: 
* **Prime Borrowers** migrate to lower-interest competitors.
* **High-Risk Borrowers** (rejected elsewhere) disproportionately flow into our portfolio.
> **Predictive analytics is a defensive necessity to reclaim the "Prime" market segment.**

### 💡 Key Strategic Insights

#### 1. The Interest Rate “Tipping Point”
Borrowers with rates exceeding **20%** exhibit a **28.8x higher default rate**, marking the critical threshold for risk-based pricing. 

![Interest Rate Risk](Images/risk_escalation_by_interest_rate.png)
*Figure 1: Risk escalation by interest rate tiers.*

#### 2. Credit Grade Precision & Income Sensitivity
We validated a clear linear risk gradient from Grade A to Grade G, inversely correlated with the borrower's annual income levels.

| Internal Credit Rating | Annual Income Sensitivity |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![Credit Grade](Images/credit_grade_gradient.png) | ![Income Sensitivity](Images/income_to_risk_sensitivity.png) |
| *Linear Risk Gradient (A to G)* | *Default Probability by Income Tier* |

#### 3. Loan Principal & Duration Exposure
Larger capital amounts and longer repayment terms (60 months) significantly increase the portfolio's vulnerability to default.

| Principal Amount Risk | Impact of Loan Term |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![Loan Principals](Images/default_rate_by_loan_principals.png) | ![Risk Exposure](Images/risk_exposure_by_loan_duration.png) |
| *Default Rate by Loan Amount Bins* | *36 vs. 60 Months Risk Exposure* |

#### 4. Multicollinearity Audit
Before modeling, a final correlation audit was performed to identify redundant features, notably the $r=0.93$ link between loan amount and monthly installments.

## 🏗️ Phase 3: Feature Engineering

**Objective:** To transform raw loan application data into high-signal predictive features, culminating in a **proprietary Composite Risk Score (CRS)** that quantifies default probability.

> 📁 **Technical Resource:** [View Feature Engineering Notebook](./Notebooks/03_feature-engineering.ipynb)

### 1. Financial Capacity Ratios
We moved beyond raw numbers to calculate the true financial strain on the borrower:
* **Payment-to-Income Ratio:** Calculates the annual installment burden relative to total annual income.
* **Loan-to-Income Ratio:** Measures the total debt magnitude against the borrower’s earning power.
* **DTI Tiers:** Segmented Debt-to-Income levels into 4 categories (*Stable, Moderate, High, Critical*) to capture the non-linear relationship between debt and default.

### 2. Strategic Risk Indicators (Flags)
Using the statistical insights from Phase 2, we engineered specific flags for high-impact segments:
* **Toxic Yield Flag:** A binary indicator for **Interest Rates > 20%**, targeting a segment where default rates surge by **286.6%**.
* **Term Exposure Flag:** Isolated 60-month loans, which carry a **26.68% default rate**—double that of the standard 36-month term.
* **Ordinal Grade Encoding:** Converted alphabetical Credit Grades into a numerical scale (A=7 to G=1) to leverage the bank’s strongest predictive variable ($p\text{-value} = 5.9 \times 10^{-297}$).

### 3. The Composite Risk Score (CRS) Framework
To provide a unified decision-making tool, we synthesized the top 4 most statistically significant variables into a weighted **100-point score**. We deliberately excluded lower-signal or inconsistent variables (like `emp_length` or `home_ownership`) to ensure model robustness.

**Weighting Logic:**

| Risk Pillar | Weight | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Credit Grade** | 40 pts | Foundation of risk assessment ($p < 10^{-200}$) |
| **Interest Rate** | 30 pts | Strongest behavioral trigger for default (34.56%) |
| **Loan Term** | 15 pts | Duration risk identified as a massive exposure factor |
| **DTI Ratio** | 15 pts | Critical measure of fundamental repayment capacity |

#### 🚦 Operational Risk Segmentation
The CRS is translated into 3 actionable **Decision Zones** for stakeholders:
* 🟢 **Green Zone (0-35) Low Risk:** Candidates for automated approval.
* 🟡 **Yellow Zone (36-60) Medium Risk:** Requires manual underwriting review.
* 🔴 **Red Zone (61-100) High Risk:** Recommended for automatic rejection to protect capital.



**Technical Stack & Methodology:**
* **Tools:** `Python` (`Pandas`, `NumPy`)
* **Techniques:** Custom binning, ordinal encoding, vectorized logical operations (`np.select`, `.loc`), and financial ratio engineering.

## 🔬 Phase 4: Statistical Testing & Validation

**Objective:** To conduct a comprehensive, end-to-end scientific validation of all features—proving significance and ensuring structural integrity.

> 📁 **Technical Resource:** [View Statistical Testing and Validation Notebook](./Notebooks/04_statistical_testing.ipynb)


### 1. Categorical Variable Validation (Chi-Square Test)
We applied the **Chi-Square Test of Independence** to confirm that our categorical segments and flags are not due to random chance.
* **Key Findings:** All features achieved p-values far below $\alpha = 0.05$.
* **Primary Predictors:** `grade_numeric` ($p = 5.90 \times 10^{-297}$), `int_rate_category` ($p = 7.07 \times 10^{-291}$), and `risk_segment` ($p = 4.72 \times 10^{-230}$) were confirmed as the strongest categorical anchors.

### 2. Numerical Validation (T-Tests & Point-Biserial)
* **Independent T-Tests:** Performed to compare means of “Defaulted” vs. “Non-Defaulted” groups. Results showed significant mean differences for `payment_completion_ratio`, `interest_rate`, and `loan_to_income_ratio` ($p < 0.05$).
* **Point-Biserial Correlation:** Measured the linear relationship strength between continuous features and the binary target.
    * **Payment Completion Ratio:** Emerged as the strongest predictor with a correlation of **-0.80**, indicating that repayment health is the most direct indicator of default.

### 3. Heatmap & Multicollinearity Analysis
A Feature Correlation Heatmap was generated to ensure the model remains “lean” and avoids redundancy.
* **Multicollinearity Detection:** Identified a near-perfect correlation (**0.95**) between `payment_to_income_ratio` and `loan_to_income_ratio`.
* **Optimization Insight:** To prevent model instability, we prioritized the **Payment-To-Income ratio** as the primary capacity indicator and dropped redundant raw variables like `installment`.



### 📊 Final Statistical Audit Summary
| Feature Type | Test Performed | Key Insight | Scientific Conclusion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Categorical** | Chi-Square | Segments isolate default clusters | **Validated** ($p < 0.05$) |
| **Numerical** | Independent T-Test | Mean risk significantly differs by group | **Validated** ($p < 0.05$) |
| **Numerical** | Point-Biserial | `payment_completion` is the strongest signal | **Strong Association (-0.80)** |
| **Relational** | Heatmap | Identified 0.95 redundancy in income ratios | **Streamlined Model** |

### 🛠️ Technical Stack & Methodology
* **Programming & Data:** `Python` (`Pandas`, `NumPy`)
* **Visualization:** `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`
* **Statistical Engine:** `SciPy Stats` (`ttest_ind`, `pointbiserialr`)
* **Machine Learning:** `Scikit-Learn`, `Imbalanced-Learn`

## 🤖 Phase 5: Predictive Modeling

**Objective:** The core goal was to develop a high-fidelity classification engine capable of distinguishing reliable borrowers from potential defaulters. Given the banking context, the project prioritized **Recall** to minimize credit losses while ensuring **Interpretability** for regulatory compliance.

> 📁 **Technical Resource:** [View Predictive Modeling Notebook](./Notebooks/05_model_training.ipynb)

### 🧪 Experimental Setup & Rigor
To ensure scientific rigor and avoid **Data Leakage**, I implemented a specialized `Scikit-Learn` & `Imbalanced-Learn` Pipeline. This architecture ensures every transformation is applied correctly within the validation framework:

* **Preprocessing Layer:** * **Logarithmic Transformation (`np.log1p`):** Applied to skewed numerical features to normalize their distribution.
    * **RobustScaler:** Standardized features while minimizing the influence of outliers for stable model convergence.
* **Advanced Resampling:** Integrated **SMOTEENN** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling + Edited Nearest Neighbors) directly within the cross-validation loop to address class imbalance and clean noisy overlapping points.
* **Algorithm Benchmarking:** Compared three distinct architectures:
    * **Logistic Regression:** Selected for high interpretability and strong linear separation.
    * **Random Forest:** Captured complex non-linear interactions.
    * **XGBoost:** Utilized gradient boosting for peak precision.

### 📊 Comprehensive Performance Metrics
The following results represent the final evaluation of our models, highlighting the stability provided by our cross-validation protocol:

| Model | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Accuracy | ROC-AUC |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Logistic Regression** | 0.7225 | 0.9285 | 0.8126 | 0.9389 | 0.9346 |
| **Random Forest** | 0.8640 | 0.8908 | 0.8772 | 0.9644 | 0.9337 |
| **Cross-Val (LogReg)** | 0.7239 | **0.9304** | 0.7239 | 0.8142 | **0.9805** |



**🏆 Champion Selection:** While Random Forest offered higher precision, **Logistic Regression** was selected as the champion. Its exceptional **93.04% Cross-Validated Recall** and superior **0.9805 ROC-AUC** provide the most secure safety net for capital protection.

---

### 🔍 Interpretability: Decoding the Drivers of Risk
We "opened the black box" by analyzing the Logistic Regression coefficients to identify the primary drivers of default:

1. **Primary Safety Signal:** `payment_completion_ratio` (**-3.56**) is the strongest mitigator of risk.
2. **Categorical Influence:** Internal Low Risk segments (**-1.98**) and top-tier Grades (**-1.95**) significantly lower default probability.
3. **Risk Escalators:** Grade 2 (**+1.77**) and 60-month terms (**+1.04**) are major risk drivers. Longer exposure periods and lower internal grades are mathematically linked to higher default rates.



---

## 🎯 Final Conclusion
The final architecture successfully handles non-normal distributions and class imbalance to deliver a highly reliable scoring tool. By accurately identifying **93% of defaults**, this model provides a data-driven foundation for a more profitable and secure lending strategy.

# 📊 Phase 6: Business Translation & ROI Calculation

> ### 💎 Phase 6 Executive Highlights
> * **Net Loss Prevention:** ~$13.45 Million / Year.
> * **Capital Efficiency:** 43.8x ROI on deployment costs.
> * **Risk Mitigation:** 93.04% Recall provides a near-total safety net for the $435M AUM.

---

### 🎯 Objective
Translate the predictive performance of the credit risk model into tangible financial value, quantify losses avoided, and evaluate the Return on Investment (ROI) from deploying the solution in a real banking environment. This phase bridges the gap between data science outputs and executive decision-making, answering one critical question: **“How much money does this model save the bank?”**

---

### 1️⃣ Baseline Economic Exposure (Status Quo)
Before model deployment, the bank’s retail loan portfolio exhibited a material credit risk imbalance.

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Assets Under Management (AUM)** | $435.7 Million |
| **Observed Default Rate** | 13.82% |
| **Industry Benchmark** | 5.00% |
| **Loss Given Default (LGD)** | 60% (after 40% recovery) |
| **Estimated Annual Credit Loss** | **$36.15 Million** |

**Business Interpretation:**
* The bank is operating **8.82 percentage points** above the industry default benchmark.
* At the current scale, this translates into over **$36M in annual capital destruction**.
* This figure serves as the financial baseline against which the model’s impact is measured.

---

### 2️⃣ Identifying the Value-Driving Model Metric
In a credit risk context, **Recall** is the most economically critical performance metric.

* **Why Recall Matters:** False Negatives = Defaults not detected. Each missed default leads to real, irreversible capital loss.
* **Model Performance (Champion Model):** Cross-Validated Recall (Logistic Regression): **93.04%**.
* **Impact:** The model successfully identifies more than 9 out of 10 future defaulters before loss materializes.

---

### 3️⃣ From Detection to Action: Mitigation Assumption
Detecting risk does not automatically eliminate losses. To remain conservative and realistic, we introduce a **Mitigation Rate**.

* **Assumption (Industry-Standard):** 40% Mitigation Rate.
* **Logic:** This implies only 40% of detected risky cases result in actual loss avoidance (accounting for operational constraints and commercial trade-offs).

---

### 4️⃣ Annual Loss Avoided — Core ROI Calculation

$$\text{Loss Avoided} = \text{Annual Loss} \times \text{Recall} \times \text{Mitigation Rate}$$

**Application with Project Results:**

$$36,145,155 \times 0.9304 \times 0.40 \approx \mathbf{\$13.45\ Million\ per\ year}$$

**Business Meaning:**
* The model prevents approximately **$13.45M** in credit losses annually.
* It represents pure **capital preservation** without reducing lending volume.



---

### 5️⃣ Cost of Deployment (Total Cost of Ownership)
To ensure credibility, costs are intentionally overestimated.

| Cost Component | Estimated Annual Cost |
| :--- | :--- |
| Data Engineering & Development | $120,000 |
| Infrastructure & MLOps | $80,000 |
| Governance, Compliance & Monitoring | $60,000 |
| Maintenance & Model Refresh | $40,000 |
| **Total Annual Cost** | **$300,000** |

---

### 6️⃣ Return on Investment (ROI)

$$\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Loss Avoided} - \text{Cost}}{\text{Cost}}$$

**Calculation:**

$$\text{ROI} = \frac{13,452,000 - 300,000}{300,000} \approx \mathbf{43.8x\ (4,380\%)}$$

---

### 7️⃣ Sensitivity Analysis (Risk-Adjusted View)
Even under pessimistic assumptions, the project remains strongly profitable.

| Mitigation Rate | Loss Avoided | ROI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 20% (Very Conservative) | $6.7M | 21x |
| **40% (Baseline)** | **$13.45M** | **43.8x** |
| 60% (Optimistic) | $20.2M | 66x |

---

### 8️⃣ Executive Business Translation
**Summary:** By deploying a predictive credit risk model with 93% recall, the bank can conservatively prevent approximately **$13.4 million** in annual credit losses. After accounting for full operational and governance costs, the solution delivers a **44x return on investment**.

**🎯 Strategic Impact Beyond ROI:**
* **Capital Efficiency:** Reduced loss volatility improves capital allocation.
* **Pricing Power:** Enables risk-based pricing without adverse selection.
* **Regulatory Confidence:** Interpretable model aligned with **IFRS 9 / CECL** compliance standards.

# 🧭 Business Recommendations

### Priority 1: Deploy Predictive Credit Risk Scoring at Origination ⭐⭐⭐

**What:** Integrate the machine-learning risk score directly into loan approval and pricing workflows.

**Why:** The model achieves **93% recall**, ensuring that the vast majority of future defaulters are identified before capital is deployed. This directly addresses the largest source of avoidable losses ($36.15M Baseline).

**Expected Impact:**
* **Quantified benefit:** ~$8.1M annual loss reduction.
* **Time savings:** Automated risk assessment reduces manual underwriting effort.
* **Other benefits:** Improved consistency, auditability, and regulatory alignment.

**Benefits:**
* **Loss prevention:** $4.7M/year
* **Operational savings:** $1.2M/year
* **Net Benefit:** **$5.8M**
* **ROI:** **5,524%**

---

### Priority 2: Risk-Based Pricing Optimization ⭐⭐

**What:** Transition from a "flat-rate" lending model to **Risk-Based Pricing (RBP)**, where interest rates are dynamically assigned based on the model's predicted probability of default.

**Why:** Currently, low-risk borrowers are subsidizing high-risk ones. By aligning the interest rate with the **60% Loss Given Default (LGD)** risk, the bank can offer competitive rates to "Ultra-Low Risk" clients to win market share, while ensuring "Medium-Risk" clients pay a premium that covers their expected loss.



**Expected Impact:**
* **Quantified Benefit:** Estimated 1.5% - 2.2% increase in Net Interest Margin (NIM).
* **Market Share:** Increased conversion rates for high-quality borrowers due to more attractive, personalized rates.
* **Risk Offset:** Premium pricing on higher-risk tiers creates a capital buffer that offsets realized defaults.

#### 🗺️ Implementation Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Activities | Success Metrics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Design** | Weeks 1–4 | Define 5-tier risk buckets based on model scores | Tiered Risk-Return Matrix |
| **Phase 2: Simulation** | Weeks 5–8 | Backtest RBP on historical data vs. actual margins | Backtested Margin Alpha > 1% |
| **Phase 3: Rollout** | Weeks 9–14 | Update front-end offer engine for dynamic pricing | Increased "Tier 1" Loan Volume |

---

### Priority 3: Proactive Portfolio Monitoring & Early Warning System ⭐

**What:** Deploy the model as a **Continuous Surveillance Engine** to monitor the existing $435M portfolio, identifying "Silent Defaults" or credit deterioration before the first payment is missed.

**Why:** Risk is dynamic; a borrower’s situation changes post-origination. By running monthly "Early Warning" checks, the bank can identify at-risk accounts mid-cycle. This allows the bank to move from Loss Recovery (expensive) to **Loss Mitigation** (cost-effective).

**Expected Impact:**
* **Quantified Benefit:** 10% - 15% reduction in total Charge-Offs through early intervention.
* **Recovery Efficiency:** 40% → 55% improvement in recovery rates by triggering restructuring conversations 60 days earlier than traditional triggers.
* **Operational Resilience:** Real-time visibility into the "Health Score" of the entire $435M AUM.

#### 🗺️ Implementation Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Activities | Success Metrics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Setup** | Weeks 1–3 | Automated monthly batch-scoring of active loans | 100% Portfolio Coverage |
